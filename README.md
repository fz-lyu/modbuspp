# MODBUS++  (MODBSPP)   V0.1
MODBUS++ (MODBUSPP) is an open source c++ class/ library making an encapsulation of 
[Modbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus) TCP Protocol published by Modicon 
(Now Schneider Electirc).

MODBUS++ is based on Object-Oriented Programming. While it keeps the efficiency of C++ Code

easier for programmers to use in their development requiring MODBUS TCP Protocol.
